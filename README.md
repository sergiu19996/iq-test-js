# Deployment

-The site was deployed to GitHub pages.The steps deploy are as follows:

-In the GitHub repository,navigate to the Settings tab

-From the source section drop-down menu select Master branch

-Once the master branch has been selected the page provided the ling to the completed website

-I started off by creating a local git repo with teh command git init -then at regular points I added new changes with teh command git add .

then committed them to my local git staging area with git commit -m 'useful comment'
then push my local git repo to the external one using git push
